## 🔎 Introduction

This project provides a possibility to explore happiness scores in countries around the world using a Power BI dashboard. 

## 📂 Data Overview

There are five different CSV files one for each from 2015 to 2019. They include country names, happiness ranks and scores as well as scores from different studies.

**Data Cleanup:** Before the analysis, I cleaned the data using Power Query by manipulating columns, changing data types, rounding decimal places.
